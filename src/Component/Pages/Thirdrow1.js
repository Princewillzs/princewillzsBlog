				As you can see, styled-components lets you write actual CSS in your JavaScript. This means you can use
				all the features of CSS you use and love, including (but by far not limited to) media queries, all
				pseudo-selectors, nesting, etc. The last step is that we need to define what a primary button looks
				like. To do that we also import css from styled-components and interpolate a function into our template
				literal, which gets passed the props of our component:
			</p>
		</div>
	);
}

export default Thirdrow1;
